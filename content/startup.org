* Startup

*** PROs:
 - implement basic features and release the MVP ASAP - as an old saying goes: "if you are not ashamed with your first release you are already too late"
 - setup initial users base and aim for 10x customer acquisition
 - roll-out new features and get into fail-fast feedback loop

*** CONs:
 - early optimizations/scale and security - the defaults provided by the framework is more than enough for initial bootstrapping stage
 - long scheduled releases - this kills the early feedback loop and might lead the project into wrong directions
