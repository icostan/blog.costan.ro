** Terminology
   A bit of terminology first:

   \[
   \color{blue}
   P - Principal / Price / Present\ value
   \\
   Px - Principal + interest\ after\ 'x'\ years
   \\
   \color{red}
   r - Annual\ interest\ rate
   \\
   \color{green}
   t - Years
   \]


** Simple interest rate

   Let /*P*/ be the principal that is borrowed, after first year the balance that needs to be paid back is the principal /*P*/ plus the interest:

   \[
   \\
   P1 = P + r*P
   \]

   after two years we have the principal plus the interest for 2 years:
   \[
   \\
   P2 = P + r*P + r*P
   \\
   \]

   then after 3 years ...
   \[
   \\
   P3 = P + r*P + r*P + r*P
   \\
   \]

   we can see that /*r*P*/ term repeats for each year, generalize for /*t*/ years:
   \[
   \\
   Pt = P + t*r*P
   \\
   \]

   and finally extract /*P*/ and remember the formula for later use:
   \[
   \color{blue}
   S = P*(1 + r*t)
   \]

   Let's see a simple example, borrow $100 at 12% annual rate for 20 years:

   #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
     p, r, t = 100, 0.12, 20
     s = p * (1 + t*r)
     print('$%.2f' % s)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : $340.00

   Looks right, $100 at 12% interest rate makes $12/year for 20 years is $240 plus $100.

** Compounding interest rate
*** Yearly compounding

   When compounding, we use previous year's balance /*Px*/ (intermediate principal) instead of initial principal /*P*/.

   after 1 year:
   \[
   P1 = P + r*P
   \\
   P1 = P*(1 + r)
   \]

   2nd year:
   \[
   P2 = P1 + r*P1
   \\
   P2 = P*(1 + r) + r*P*(1 + r)
   \\
   P2 = P(1 + r)(1 + r)
   \\
   P2 = P(1 + r)^2
   \]

   3rd year
   \[
   P3 = P2 + r*P2
   \\
   P3 = P*(1 + r)^3
   \]

   and so on, you've got the idea, by the same technique after /*t*/ years we end up with:
   \[
   \color{blue}
   C = P*(1 + r)^t
   \]

   Same example as above with annual compound:

   #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
     c = p * (1 + r)**t
     print('$%.2f' % c)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : $964.63

   Wow, look at that, /*$964*/ vs /*$340*/, the final balance when compounding is a lot bigger, which makes sense, after first year we receive interest on interest and balance adds up quickly.

*** Monthly compounding
   Let's introduce a new variable /*n*/ which is the number of periods in a year:
   - monthly interest rate: /*r/n*/
   - total compounded periods: /*t*n*/

   The new compounding formula is:

   \[
   \color{blue}
   C = P*(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{t*n}
   \]

   When compounding monthly we have 12 months in a year and /*n = 12*/
   #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
     n = 12
     c = p * (1 + r/n)**(t*n)
     print('$%.2f' % c)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : $1089.26


*** Daily compounding

   365 days in a year and /*n=365*/

   #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
     n = 365
     c = p * (1 + r/n)**(t*n)
     print('$%.2f' % c)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : $1101.88

   Again, /*$1101 vs. $1089 vs $964*/, the more often the compounding, the bigger the final balance.

*** Continuously compounding

    What about hourly compounding or even per minute or per millisecond? we can increase /*n*/ and get the results but I want to find a formula that fits them all starting with:
    \[
    \color{blue}
    C = P*(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{t*n}
    \]

    Since we compound more and more often then /*n*/ gets bigger and bigger and approaches infinity and we can rewrite the formula as a /limit/:
    \[
    C = \lim_{n \to +\infty} P*(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{t*n}
    \]

    Define /*x*/ variable as:
    \[
    x = \frac{n}{r}
    \\
    n = x * r
    \]

    then /*x*/ is direct proportional with /*n*/, as /*n*/ approaches infinity, then /*x*/ approaches infinity as well, /limit/ formula holds and we can substitute /*n*/ with /*x*/:
    \[
    C = \lim_{x \to +\infty} P*(1 + \frac{r}{x*r})^{t*x*r}
    \]
    extract constant /*P*/ outside the limit, cancel out /*r*/ and commute the exponents:
    \[
    C = P * (\lim_{x \to +\infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x)^{r*t}
    \]

    What does the above formula looks like? Calculus anyone? Looks like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)][Euler's number]]
    \[
    e = \lim_{x \to +\infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x
    \]

    that gets substituted and we end up with the magic /*continuous compounding formula*/:
    \[
    \color{red}
    C = P * e^{r*t}
    \]

   #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
     from math import e
     c = p * e**(r*t)
     print('$%.2f' % c)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : $1102.32

   /Takeaway/: Before moving further it is important to understand the difference between /*APY*/ (annual percentace yield) and /*APR*/ (annual percentance rate), the former include compounding interest, the latter does not. In other words /*APR*/ is simple interest and /*APY*/ is compounding interest.

** Discounted interest-rate

   What about the other way around, we are given the final (compounding value) and need to calculate the present value?

   Simple, re-arranging the compounding formula above we have:

   \[
   P = \frac{C}{e^{r*t}}
   \]
   \[
   \color{red}
   P = C * e^{-r*t}
   \]

   where /*P*/ is called the present value or discounted value and is very useful in financial valuation.

** A few tricks
*** Double your investment aka 100% profit
    OK, now, let's assume that I want to invest $1000 at 6% annual interest rate and I want to know how many years do I need to double my investment?

**** Analytical
     Let's do a bit of high school math using the annual compounding formula above.

     \[
     \textcolor{blue} {C = P*(1 + r)^t}
     \\
     \frac{C}{P} = (1 + r)^t
     \\
     t = \log_{1+r} \frac{C}{P}
     \\
     t = \frac{\ln {\frac{C}{P}}}{\ln 1+r}
     \]

     After putting in the numbers we end up with:

     \[
     t = \frac{\ln {\frac{2000}{1000}}}{\ln 1+0.06}
     \\
     \textcolor{green} {t = 11.9\ years}
     \]

     Double check in Python:

     #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
       from math import log
       t = log(2)/ log(1.06)
       print('%.1f years' % t)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 11.9 years

     Unfortunately most of the people cannot do logarithms in their heads but rest assured there is a lot easier solution.

**** Rule of 72

     As [[https://www.investopedia.com/][Investopedia]] nicely explains it: [[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp][Rule of 72]] is a formula to estimate the number of years required to double the invested money at a given annual interest rate.
     Just divide /*72*/ by the annual interest rate /*6*/ and there you have it: /*~12*/ years.

     #+begin_src python :results output :session interest
       t = 72 / 6
       print('%.1f years' % t)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 12.0 years


     Why 72?

     Detailed explanations [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72][here]] but ultimately it is as simple /*ln 2*/,

     \[
     \ln 2 = 0.693
     \]

     while /*2*/ comes from doubling ($2000 / $1000), if you need to find the tripling time just use /*3*/ or /*1.5*/ for halving time.
