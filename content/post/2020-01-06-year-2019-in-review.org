Another year ... another year passed by, I am getting older, getting wiser, here are the highlights of the year.


Trading - RED
 - Bitcoin futures - RPnL: +100% (aka 1x)
 - Bitcoin options - RPnL: -10%
 - Ethereum futures/options - RPnL: -15%
 - Litecoin futures - RPnL: -30%
 - Forex & Commodities - RPnL: -5%

Crypto - HODL
 - DeFi - RPnL: +3%
 - averaging down currencies that I like

Nomad - FAIL
 - could not adapt my trading routine to 12h time gap (5PM New York closing bell)
 - hard time balancing work and travel
 - maybe too tight on monthly budget
 - maybe more interactions would have helped

Tech - GOOD
 - [[https://gitlab.com/icostan/arch.d][Arch Linux]] - back to basics, just like old days, home brewed Linux.
 - [[https://gitlab.com/icostan/emacs.d][Vanilla Emacs]] - back to vanilla emacs configuration after 2 years of Spacemacs
 - [[https://e.foundation/][/e/]] Phone - I have finally flashed my phone and installed eOS.

Consulting - END
 - Zuppler - 1 year consulting agreement is due on Dec 31, 2019

Happy New Year ... 2020 !!!
