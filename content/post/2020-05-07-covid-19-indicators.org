I wrote a few indicators showing COVID-19 daily change/momentum for the entire world, EU vs. US and for most affected countries that have either more than 10k confirmed cases or more than  1k deaths.

Also, for EU only, daily change per capita, showing the number of cases/deaths per 1M people.

This one is quite interesting because a small country like Belgium seems to be the most affected.
At this moment (May 7th) they have 12 deaths/1M people, down from ~28 deaths/1M people two weeks ago.
