A very simple [[https://www.tradingview.com/script/1BmaNfe5-Month-breaks/][TradingView indicator]] that marks the start of every month with a vertical line. By default the vertical line is gray with 80% transparency but you can customize the style/color/transparency as you like.

I hate crowded charts, bloated with all kind of crazy shapes and I created this indicator for two main reasons:

1. beginning/end of the month is an excellent pivot-point
2. to be simple, easy to customize and non-intrusive with the underlying chart

See the EURUSD daily chart below, at the beginning of every month the price pivoted up and down, can you figure out what happens at the end of Dec 2019?

Trade long and prosper!
