** Intro.
   In [[/post/2019-11-07-in-file-navigation/][Part 1]] of Emacs series I presented /the movement/ (or navigation within a single buffer/window), in this part I am going to demo /the navigation/ between multiple windows/files/buffers.

   In mode-line (status bar) you can see the keys that are being pressed and the functions that are executed.

   A bit if Emacs terminology:
   1. *Frame* - top level graphical object associated with underlying Emacs process
   2. *Window* - a frame can be split in multiple windows
   3. *File* - a file on disk
   4. *Buffer* - a file that is opened in a window

** 1 Frames navigation
   Since a frame is just a GUI app it will not be very interesting to demo new/close or resize actions so I will skip it.
*** 1.1 new/close frame
    - new frame: *SPC-q-m*
    - close frame: *SPC-q-d*
    - quit emacs (close all frames): *SPC-q-q*
    - restart emacs: *SPC-q-r*
*** 1.2 resize frame
    - toggle fullscreen: *SPC-q-f*
** 2 Files navigation
   Finding files is simple, yet very powerful and with 3 key stokes I can reach any file on my computer in no time.
*** 2.1 find file
    - in current project: *SPC-f-p*
    - in all known projects: *SPC-f-P*
    - globally (on disk): *SPC-f-G*
    [[file:/img/emacs/find-file.gif]]
*** 2.2 find directory
    - parent of current file: *SPC f j*
    - within project: *SPC f d*
    [[file:/img/emacs/find-dir.gif]]
*** 2.3 find extension
    - file with different extension: *SPC f e*

** 3 Windows navigation
   All /window/ related commands are bundled under *"SPC w"* keymap as follows.
*** 3.1 split window (aka new)
    - horizontally: *SPC-w-|*
    - vertically: *SPC-w- -*
    [[file:/img/emacs/split-window.gif]]
*** 3.2 go to window
    - left, right: *SPC-w-h*, *SPC-w-l*
    - bottom, top: *SPC-w-j*, *SPC-w-k*
    - selection: *SPC-w-w-1*, *SPC-w-w-5*
    - swap: *SPC-w-s-4*
    [[file:/img/emacs/go-to-window.gif]]
*** 3.3 delete window
    - selection: *SPC-w-D-3*
    - this window: *SPC-w-d*
    - other windows: *SPC-w-x*
    [[file:/img/emacs/delete-window.gif]]
*** 3.4 resize window
    - golden ratio: *SPC w g*
** 4 Buffers navigation
   A /buffer/ is just a /file/ that is opened in a /window/.
*** 4.1 switch to buffer
    - project buffer: *SPC-b-p*
    - select any buffer: *SPC-b-b*
    - special buffers like dashboard: *SPC-b-g-d*
    [[file:/img/emacs/switch-buffer.gif]]
*** 4.2 new/save/close buffer
    - new: *SPC-f-p* (automatically when a file is opened)
    - close: *SPC-b-d*
    - save: *SPC-b-s*
