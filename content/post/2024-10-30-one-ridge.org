** Uniting the Carpathians through a continuous trekking route

The mission of OneRidge project is to design and establish a continuous trekking route(s) that spans the length of Romania’s Carpathian Mountains, starting from the Iron Gates in the southwest and stretching all the way to the northern border with Ukraine.

It will traverse each of Romania’s main Carpathian mountain groups individually, following the primary ridges (usually marked with red stripe) and reaching the highest peaks in each mountain range.

The Carpathian Mountains in Romania are typically divided into three main groups, each with distinct geographic and geological characteristics:

*** 1. Eastern Carpathians (Carpații Orientali)
  - Stretching from the northern border of Romania down to the Prahova Valley.
  - Known for rolling hills, deep valleys, and some volcanic formations.

*** 2. Southern Carpathians (Carpații Meridionali)
  - Also known as the Transylvanian Alps, located between the Prahova Valley and the Iron Gates.
  - Characterized by rugged peaks, deep gorges, and some of the highest peaks in Romania, including Moldoveanu and Negoiu.

*** 3. Western Carpathians (Carpații Occidentali)
  - Also known as the Apuseni Mountains, found in the western part of Romania, primarily within Transylvania.
  - Known for karst formations, caves, and picturesque landscapes with lower elevations compared to the Southern and Eastern Carpathians.
