With only two months remaining until the Gasherbrum2 expedition I put together a training plan, kind of writting in stone, let's see how it goes.

** 1. The plan - S.M.A.R.T.
   I first read about this training plan in /*Mountaineering - Freedom of the hills*/ book and it made sense to me back then, now it's time to try it.
*** Specific
    The best training for high altitude mountaineering is of course high altitude mountaineering... smart huh? unfortunately I do not have neither high altitude nor mountains around, that's why I needed find different sport-specific exercises:
    - cardio: hill climbing / stairs stepper with pack
    - strength: dead lift/reverse step-up/calf rises + squats/lunges variations
    - high altitude mask
*** Measurable
    - measure, compare and adjust along the way
*** Action-oriented
    - write down a structured training plan
    - find a balance between training and work/life/other commitments
    - individualized
*** Realistic
    - setting very high goals with little chance of success is useless, a step by step, incremental approach is better
    - dont do the "too much, too soon" mistake
*** Time-based
    - training details per each day/week

** 2. The goals

With all the above in mind, lets set the goals:

*** The training goal
    To climb 3000m elevation with a 10kg pack in 10 hours by Jun 14th.

*** The ultimate goal
    To climb Gasherbrum2 peak (8035m) without bottled oxygen, survive and tell the story.

** 3. The schedule

***  Week 0 - Apr 12th: The research [DONE]
    Mostly researching high altitude training techniques, try things out, create this plan.
