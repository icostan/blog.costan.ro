My second indicator in this series is Slices of Bitcoin, a very simple indicator that shows how many times a currency fits into Bitcoin.
Here is the [[https://www.tradingview.com/script/KpC7qdOE-Slices-of-Bitcoin/][source code]].

In other words, the higher the value of indicator, the weaker the currency against Bitcoin.

You can easily see that since the beginning of 2019 [[https://www.stellar.org/][Stellar Lumen (XLM)]] lost half of its BTC value while the USD value was constant.

Trade short and prosper!
