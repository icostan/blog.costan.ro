Maybe one of the most effective indicator that I use on daily basis, [[https://www.tradingview.com/script/g8tZWz2Q-Price-breaks/][Price breaks]].

Again and again you can see how previous day/week/month's high/low and especially close act as support/resistance and how price bounces off these levels.

The shapes:
 - month's high/low/close are marked with circles
 - week's high/low/close marked with crosses
 - day's high/low/close with lines

The colors:
- red - the highs
- green - the lows
- blue - the closes

Trade long and prosper!
