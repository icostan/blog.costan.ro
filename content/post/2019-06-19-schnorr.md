[Schnorr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature) is another digital signature scheme known for its simplicity, no division, no inversion, just plain old multiplication. Here is my simple 16 lines implementation in Python.

     1  import random, hashlib
     2  p = 103
     3  q = 17
     4  r  = 6
     5  h = random.choice([h for h in range(1, p) if h**r % p != 1 ])
     6  g = h**r % p
     7  k = random_prime(q)
     8  y = g**k % q
     9  m = 6
    10  t = random_prime(q)
    11  r = g**t % q
    12  e = int(hashlib.sha1(str(r) + str(m)).hexdigest(), 16) % q
    13  s = (t - k*e)
    14  rv = (g**s * y**e) % q
    15  ev = int(hashlib.sha1(str(rv) + str(m)).hexdigest(), 16) % q
    16  print "YOU ARE A CRYPTOSTAR!" if ev == e else "YOU SUCK!"

    YOU ARE A CRYPTOSTAR!


# Discrete logarithm trapdoor

  To generate a Schnorr group that stands at the base of our Schnorr signature scheme we need to generate \`p\`, \`q\` and \`r\` numbers that satisfy the equation: \`p = q\*r + 1\` where \`p\` and \`q\` are primes.
You can use any algorithm (even brute-force) to generate the numbers, here are mine:

    1  p = 103
    2  q = 17
    3  r  = 6

Next we need to find a generator \`g\` that generates our sub-group of order \`q\`. Basically we brute-force and select all numbers less than \`p\` that satisfy the equation \`h\*\*r % p != 1\`, choose a random one then the remainder is our generator \`g\`. The math is a bit involved, please see [Schnorr group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_group) for more info:

    4  h = random.choice([h for h in range(1, p) if h**r % p != 1 ])
    5  g = h**r % p

Once we have the generator \`g\` we need to pick a [random prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n) as private key \`k\` and generate the public key \`y\`.

    6  k = random_prime(q)
    7  y = g**k % q

And finally \`g\`, \`y\` are public parameters while \`k\` is kept secret:

    (g, y)

    (64, 16)


# Signature

For signing we first generate a temporary random nonce \`t\` and the corresponding member of the group \`r\`. Then group member \`r\` gets concatenated with the message \`m\` that we need to sign, hash everything together and create pre-image \`e\`. And finally the challenge signature number \`s\`.

     8  m = 6
     9  t = random_prime(q)
    10  r = g**t % q
    11  e = int(hashlib.sha1(str(r) + str(m)).hexdigest(), 16) % q
    12  s = (t - k*e)

The signature that is made public to third-party for verification is the pair \`e, s\`:

    (e, s)

    (10, -7)


# Verification

Given the public parameters and the signature above we can easily calculate random group member \`rv\` that is used to hash the final pre-image for verification:

    13  rv = (g**s * y**e) % q
    14  ev = int(hashlib.sha1(str(rv) + str(m)).hexdigest(), 16) % q
    15  print "YOU ARE A CRYPTOSTAR!" if ev == e else "YOU SUCK!"

    YOU ARE A CRYPTOSTAR!


# Intuition

Starting with the verification equation and replacing \`s\` and \`y\` with corresponding formulas we end up with \`rv == r\`.

    1  rv = g**s * y**e
    2  rv = g**(t - k*e) * y**e
    3  rv = g**(t - k*e) * g**(k*e)
    4  rv = g**t

Because \`rv\` and \`r\` are equal the two pre-image hashes must be equal as well. MAGIC!
