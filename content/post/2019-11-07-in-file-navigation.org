First thing first, lets split in-file navigation into 3 main categories:

  1. moving - moves the cursor anywhere within visible screen stands still
  2. scrolling - screen moves but cursor's position remains the same
  3. jumping - move anywhere within the current file/buffer, both cursor position and screen change

And here are my main navigation goodies that I use in day-by-day development.

** Moving
   Cursor moves, screen does not
*** horizontally by char/column
    - absolute column index: |, 5|
    - single char left/right: h, l
    - multiple chars: 4h, 3l
    - any char on the line: fc, Fc

*** horizontally by token/word
    - beginning/end of next token: w, b
    - beginning/end of next word: W, B
    - multiple token: 3w, 3b
    - multiple words: 3W, 3B
    - end of current/next token/word: e, E

*** horizontally at beginning/end of line
    - beginning of line: 0
    - end of line: $
    - first non-blank char: ^
    - last non-blank char: g_

    - single line: "j", "k"
    - multiple lines: "6j", "6k"

    - up: "}"
    - down: "{"
   [[file:/img/out-9.gif]]
*** on visible screen
    - open/close brace: "%"
    - top/middle/bottom: "H", "M", "L"
    - char/word/line: "C-c m c", "C-c m w", "C-c m l"
