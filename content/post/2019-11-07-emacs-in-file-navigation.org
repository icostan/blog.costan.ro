Here are my Emacs in-file navigation goodies that I use on daily basis, splitted into 3 main categories:

  1. moving - cursor moves, screen does not
  2. scrolling - screen moves, cursor does not
  3. jumping - both cursor and screen move .

** 1. Moving
   Moves the cursor anywhere within visible screen, while the screen stands still.

*** 1.1 horizontally by char/column
    - absolute column index: |, 5|
    - single char left/right: h, l
    - multiple chars: 4h, 3l
    - any char on the line: fc, Fc

*** 1.2 horizontally by token/word
    - beginning/end of next token: w, b
    - beginning/end of next word: W, B
    - multiple token: 3w, 3b
    - multiple words: 3W, 3B
    - end of current/next token/word: e, E

*** 1.3 horizontally at beginning/end of line
    - beginning of line: 0
    - end of line: $
    - first non-blank char: ^
    - last non-blank char: g_

** 2. Scrolling
   Screen moves but cursor's position remains the same

    - top of the screen: "zt"
    - middle of the screen: "zz"
    - bottom of the screen: "zb"

    - up: "C-e"

** 3. Jumping
   Jump anywhere within the current file/buffer, both cursor's position and screen change.
