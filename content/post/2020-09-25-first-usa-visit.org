It's been 20 fuckin' years since I set foot on the US soil for the very first time...

Here are the reminiscences of good old times:
- getting a B1 visa at that time was quite a challenge
- I travelled by myself since my colleague did not receive the USA visa
- had an incident at immigration office and missed the connection flight
- my English was pretty bad at that time (I am still working on it)
- checked baggage did not arrive and I had nothing but the clothes on me
- my first US photo was a quick shot of big, green road signs the way from airport
- stayed at /307 N Commons Ford Rd, Austin, Texas, 78733/

- used to spend weekends by the pool drinking Margarita, what a life
- I remember I was really imppressed by multi-level bridges/highways
- the gap between US and RO was huge at that time, a total different world
- Iulius Mall (first mall in Iasi) was under construction
- I was quite nervous when I went to [[https://bizstanding.com/p/moneystar+communications-145259631][Moneystar's office]]
- huge corporate building, full of employees working in cubicles
- had my own 2x2m cubicle with phone desk, computer and two monitors, fancy!
- young and restless (21+ yo), looked even younger (w/o beard)
- I had to get an ID card to get into bars/buy alcohol, lucky me

- as always, what happens in 6th St, Austin stays in Austin :)
- I had great time travelling around with colleagues
- weekend break in San Antonio, [[https://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/][River Walk]], was awesome
- I saw sky-scrappers for the very first time in Houston
- also, open day at [[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html][NASA Johnson Space Center]] was impressive
- but missed the opportunity to see NY and World Trade Center ...

Happy memories!
