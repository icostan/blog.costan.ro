Here is the 4-week training plan for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit][Annapurna Circuit]], a bit different than [[/post/2021-04-15-gasherbrum2-training-plan/][Gasherbrum2 training plan]] for a few reasons:
  - this is mostly endurance trekking d:~15km/day and h:~1000m/day for about 15 days
  - the highest altitude will only be 5400m with 3-4 days above 4000m

** Program
  - free-athlete training style - without using any facilities (no gym equip/pool/weights/belts, nada) just man-against-nature
  - train the joints - usually the joints are weaker than muscles and either cause pain (Achilles?) or fail first (knees anyone?)
  - specific exercises - focus mostly on exercises that are specific to hiking/trekking with only 1 rest day and 1 functional day per week
  - static training mask - my mask limits the quantity of oxygen only (the ones that change the concentration are much better)

** Exercises
  - *sl-RDL*: single-leg Romanian DeadLift (for hips)
  - *SU/r-SU*: Step-Up / reverse Step-Up (for knee)
  - *CR/sl-CR*: Calf Raise / single-leg Calf Raise (for ankle)
  - *L/r-L*: Lunges / reverse Lunges
  - *s-L*: split Lunges
  - *S*: Squats
  - *j-S*: jump Squats
  - *sl-S*: single-leg Squats
  - *r-SD*: reverse Step-Down
