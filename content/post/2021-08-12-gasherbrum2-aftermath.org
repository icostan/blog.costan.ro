To make a long story short I am going to lay down only a few DOs/DON'Ts (as a reminder for myself), the raw and uncut journal, and the expenses for the curious minds.

** the good (the achievements)
   - hydration - I stayed hydrated day and night, on average I drank more than 5l water/tea a day
   - acclimatization - no high altitude sickness except a single headache at ~3500m (11500ft) in Urdukas camp
   - healthy - no stomach problems, no diarrhea, no vomiting, 20 years of "what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger" lifestyle pays off
   - no pills policy  - I did not take a single pill the entire expedition, my personal 'summit'... YAAAYYY!!!
   - breathe in through nose, breathe out through mouth - I did it for some time then I stopped and started to cough :(
   - never rest (or sleep) after climbing - keep moving so heart rate goes down slowly from ~150bpm to 100/80bpm

** the bad (the mistakes)
   - left Scarpa Montblanc boots for 6000m and LaSportiva sport shoes at home
   - never tried assault (light single layer) tent before
   - heavy backpack for high altitude mountaineering ~2.2kg (7lbs)
   - carry too much for my fitness level ~10kg (30lbs), the less the  better
   - I should have trained longer/harder to increase stamina/VO2 max
   - climbing pace is important, don't rush to keep up with others, the slower the better
   - coughing is normal, part of the game, as long is does not gets worst
   - left my toiletries (toothpaste, sunscreen) at home and bought fake ones in Islamabad

** the ugly (the lows)
   - 06/21 - after I left Jhula camp when I realized that I have to walk in sandals and I might not even make it to BC
   - 07/17,18,19 - after the coughing night then solo-ing down the Banana ridge from C2 to C1 and to BC
   - 07/30 - on Karakoram highway when 3 days road block due to landslides was not a bad joke, was the reality, Ohhhh FUCK moment!!!
