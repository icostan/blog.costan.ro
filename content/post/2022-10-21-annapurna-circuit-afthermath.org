   - accommodation per person:
     - 100-200 NPR with shared bathroom

   - food (both local and international food, pizza/pasta, steaks/burgers):
     - breakfast: 500 NPR
     - lunch: 1000 NPR
     - dinner: 1500 NPR
   In high season, Oct and Nov add a 20-30% premium on all prices.
*** DOs/DON'Ts
   - no point carrying lots of food/drinks, you find teahouses every 1h or max 2h
   - the end of rainy season with clear sky in the morning and rain the in afternoon, no crazy rain, mostly a mood killer
   - leeches are very annoying (especially after rain) but won't kill you, see it as free SPA treatment
   - there are lots of stairs during the trek, be very careful when stairs are wet
   - and yes, there are also roads and jeeps but is not that bad as other people complain:
     - I would say that the worst section was between Kagbeni to Jomson, at some point we walked in river bed to avoid the dust
     - NATT (New Annapurna Trekking Trails) intersect the road here and there, it was fine for us, a good reason to enjoy a cold beer :)
   - regular trekking clothing works just fine with temperatures:
       - day: between 5째C (Thorong La at 5400m altitude) and 30째C (near Pokhara)
       - night: maybe 10째C-15째C (we did not sleep above 4500m)
   - humidity is very high, start with dry clothes in the morning, after 1h you can feel the moisture on outer layers
