### Why the blog name?


Why decentralized?

Because this is how the future looks like, the power will be taken from imagined-organizations and put back into the hands of individuals.

Why meta-learning?

Why the hard way?

I am a slow-learner who does not understand high level concepts and I like to dig deeper into the unknown to get better touch of low level implementations.

Why the easy way?

Once I understand things "the hard way" then everything else is just common sense.
